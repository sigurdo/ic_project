\section{Summary}

In this project we have designed a digital camera controller and an analog exposure and readout circuit for a 2x2 pixel digital camera. The implemented digital camera controller allows the user to adjust exposure time, initiate exposure and reset the camera. The individual pixel circuits contain NMOS transistors used as switches for the digital circuit to control, a photodiode to sense light intensity, and a capacitor that the photodiode to charges up for the digitally set exposure time. The switches were dimensioned to minimize leakage current, and the capacitor's capacitance was chosen for maximal dynamic range. The analog circuit writes the first row of pixel voltages to two ADCs before writing the second row of pixel voltages to the same ADCs. The camera controller is designed to ensure that the voltages over the pixel capacitors are erased before a new exposure is initiated. Through Verilog and AIM-Spice simulations, it is shown that the camera works according to specifications. However, if process variations make the pixel switch transistors faster than typical, the images will be extremely poorly exposed due to vast leakage currents.
