States

In any state: if rst, erase set high and state = 0 (idle)

0: idle
if init, state = 1 (exposure)
else if exp_increase, increase exposure time
else if exp_decrease, decrease exposure time

1: exposure
expose set high for the preset exposure time
if exposure time is complete, exposure set low and state = 2 (readout)

2: readout
#1 nothing
#2 NRE_R1 set low
#3 ADC set high
#4 ADC set low
#5 NRE_R1 set high
#6 NRE_R2 set low
#7 ADC set high
#8 ADC set low
#9 NRE_R2 set high
#10 nothing
#11 erase set high, state = 0 (idle)
