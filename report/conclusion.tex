\section{Conclusion}

This project has proven through simulations that one can successfully implement a simple 2x2 digital camera controller in Verilog and an analog circuit for exposure and readout in AIM-Spice. Through user inputs, the camera controller will increase and decrease the exposure time to a minimum of 2ms and a maximum of 30ms, and initialize a photo. Each pixel successfully outputs voltages varying with the light conditions and exposure time, and the camera is able to read all the different pixel values individually to the ADCs. The camera suffers when process variations cause the switch transistors to be faster than typical - this will lead to a much darker photography than desired. It will however work exceptionally well if process variations cause slower switch transistors.
