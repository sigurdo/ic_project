\section{Summary}

There are many considerations to take when designing a digital camera. In this report we have looked at two important systems, the camera controller and the pixel exposure circuit (in this report called \say{the analog circuit}). The analog circuit has been tested using SPICE simulations (using the program AIM-Spice) and the digital camera controller has been written in Verilog code and simulated in the program ActiveHDL. For the analog part we have also performed an analysis of what will happen to the switch transistors for some different process variations.
