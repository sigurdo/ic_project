\section{Introduction}

In this report we will address the design, simulation and verification of a 2 x 2 pixels digital camera. That includes mainly 2 systems: A camera controller and a pixel exposure circuit. The camera controller is a fully digital system that take input from 2 buttons to increase and decrease the exposure time, 1 button to reset the camera and 1 button to take a picture. The camera controller will based on this information provide the necessary control signals for the analog circuit to do what it should. The analog circuit is as the name suggests a fully analog system that captures light intensity in capacitors and send data about the image taken to an ADC. What happens with the signal after being sent to the ADC is beyond the scope of this report.
