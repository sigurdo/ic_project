\section{Introduction}

A digital camera can be divided into three base parts: a digital circuit taking user input and controlling the camera, an analog circuit responsible for turning varying light into varying voltages for each pixel of the camera, and another digital circuit processing and applying the voltages into a digital image. In this report, we will adress the design, simulation and verification of the digital camera controller and the analog circuit for a 2x2 pixel digital camera. The camera controller is a fully digital system that take input from two buttons to increase and decrease the exposure time, one button to reset the camera and one button to take a picture. The camera controller will based on this information provide the necessary control signals for the analog circuit to control the camera according to the specifications. The analog circuit is as the name suggests a fully analog system that captures light intensity in capacitors and send data about the image taken to an ADC. What happens with the signal after being sent to the ADC is beyond the scope of this report.
